### 3d base for brushes:

- interference between the top of the motor and this part (motor has a round extrusion at the top), fixed by melting and adjusting the print.
- very tight space for mounting the brushes (but its doable)
- no space for the brush spring (diameter bigger than the carbon)
- the height of this part makes it necessary to cut the motor shaft to allow the cables to pass before the ball bearing (depends on the motor that you buy)

### axe:

- has to be done professionally: concentric and correct diameter. (or you can buy a premade Al tube extrusion).

### RPico plate:

- the holes in the Pico do not line up on the major axis.

### construction:

- difficult but possible to assemble the motor assembly (sheet base, motor and brushbase) (because having to tighten nuts in tight spaces).

### commutator assembly:

- fit too tight on shaft, need more clearance.
- redesign to not have to solder the wires to the copper, and just use an interference fit.
