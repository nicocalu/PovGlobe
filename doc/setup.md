## Part List
- Raspberry Pi 3 B+ or newer (with Prememt RT kernel patch, documented below)
- DC motor, ~ 1200 RPM under load (results in 20 rotations per second, 20 FPS refresh rate)
- High density LED Strip with 144 LEDs/m
  - with APA102 chips, no WS28xx - their update rate is too slow!
  - e.g. Adafruit Dotstar
- Powersupply 24V (50-60W) Depends on the number of LEDs and the motor
- Carbon brushes for a slip ring to transfer electric power to the spinning globe
- 3D printed parts (from thingiverse **TODO**)
- Transparent showcase with solid base (used as a housing for the globe
