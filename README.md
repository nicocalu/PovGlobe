# PovGlobe
Forked from : @rottaca

This project consists of a 3d printed persistence of vision (POV) globe which is able to render arbitrary spherical images from appliations, written in c++ or python.
I changed some parts of the code and some physical parts, to be able to use agile fabrication tools (laser and plasma cutting machines, bending presses, etc.)
